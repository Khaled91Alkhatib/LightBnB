# LightBnB Project

LightBnB is a website that will allow home owners to rent out their homes to people on vacation, creating an alternative to hotels and bed and breakfasts.

It is done by designing and creating a database and also creating ERD for tables and using it to create tables.
Then, we add data to the database and write queries.
Finally, We connect the database to javascript application so that we can interact with the data from a webpage.
